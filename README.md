Job Posting Site

1. Introduction:
   We've created a job posting site that benefits both employers and candidates by establishing a quick and simple application process.

2. Overview:
   An employer can publish as many advertisements as they want, but only 10 can be active at the same time. The ad includes a simple text (description), but there are categories for the specific profession: QA, Developer, Manager, DevOps, PM.
   
4. Features:
   There is a reference (backend) that shows how many active listings we have by category and how many people have applied for each profession (QA, Developer, Manager, DevOps, PM).
   
5. Prerequisites:
- An employer must have a verified account in the system.
- An applicant does not need an account, but if they decide to apply for a particular advertisement, a form must be created and the following information must be provided:
    The candidate's name and on which advertisement they applied.
- A candidate can apply on any job ad, but only once per each.
